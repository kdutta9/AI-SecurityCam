## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Build Kit
- Raspberry Pi
	- I used a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
- Camera
	- I used the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/).
		
### Prerequisites
This project is built in Python 3, so use pip3 to install packages using bash:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Installing
Clone the repository into any directory of your choice by:
```bash
cd [DIRECTORY-OF-CHOICE]
git clone https://github.com/kdutta9/RPI-SecurityCam
```
I recommend using a virtual environment, using <i>virtualenv</i>, for the project, to ensure there are no errors with dependencies and such. Make sure you create in the virtual environment in the project directory.
- Installing virtualenv
	```bash
	sudo pip3 install virtualenv
	```
- Creating a virtual environment of some name (i.e. venv)
	```bash
	cd RPI-SecurityCam
	virtualenv venv
	```
- Activating virtual environment
	```bash
	source venv/bin/activate
	```

Then, install the required packages.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
